# Shortly-Express

This is a URL shortening service similar to Bitly(partially finished). The goal is to allow registered users to have their private list of shortened urls while unregistered users can still shorten urls freely without the private list feature.



So what do we need to consider? Think about authentication as a visit to a banking center. Some questions would be:

- When do we need to authenticate the client? For example, what transactions require authentication and what don't.
- As the transaction becomes more sensitive or personal, additional authentications may be required
- How to train our staffs(server) to remember the client and offer personalized service without the trouble of authentication every time
